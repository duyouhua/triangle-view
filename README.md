triangle-view
=============

A simple Android view to easily draw triangle shapes.

Usage
-----

Add the custom XML attributes from **attrs.xml** to your project.
Add a **TriangleView** to your activity the same way you'd add any other view.
The size and shape of the triangle is determined by the size given to the view.
The direction and color of the triangle is set via public setters or via the XML attributes:

 * tr_direction
 * tr_color
